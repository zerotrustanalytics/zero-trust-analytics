"Why would I pay for analytics when Google Analytics is free?"

It's the most common objection we hear. And on the surface, it makes sense. Why pay $10-30/month when you can pay $0?

But Google Analytics isn't free. **You're paying—just not with money.**

## How "Free" Products Make Money

Google's annual revenue: **$307 billion** (2023).

Google Analytics users: **Millions of websites**.

Google Analytics revenue: **$0**.

If the math doesn't add up, it's because you're not seeing the whole business model.

Google Analytics exists to fuel Google's advertising business. Every website running GA is contributing data that helps Google:

- Build more accurate user profiles
- Improve ad targeting
- Track conversions for advertisers
- Understand consumer behavior across the web

Your visitors' data is the product. Google Analytics is just the collection mechanism.

## The Data You're Giving Away

When you install Google Analytics, you're handing Google:

**About your visitors:**
- IP addresses (personal data under GDPR)
- Browsing behavior on your site
- Device fingerprints
- Geographic location
- Referral sources (what they were doing before visiting you)

**About your business:**
- Traffic patterns and growth
- Popular products/services
- Marketing channel effectiveness
- Conversion rates

This is competitive intelligence that you're providing to a company that competes with almost everyone, either directly or through businesses that advertise with them.

## The Real Costs

### Cost #1: Regulatory Risk

We've covered this elsewhere, but it's worth repeating: [GDPR fines are real](/blog/gdpr-fines-are-real-is-your-analytics-compliant/). Google Analytics has been ruled illegal in multiple EU countries. Using it creates legal liability that far exceeds any subscription cost.

Even if you never get fined, the cost of compliance—cookie consent platforms, legal reviews, consent records—adds up quickly.

### Cost #2: Page Speed

Google Analytics is not lightweight. The full GA4 implementation includes:

- Main tracking script (~45KB)
- Google Tag Manager (if used)
- Additional tracking pixels
- Cookie management code

Every kilobyte slows your page load. Research shows:

- **1 second delay** = 7% reduction in conversions
- **3 second load time** = 53% of mobile users abandon

Google literally wrote the book on page speed (Core Web Vitals), then gave you a tool that hurts your scores.

### Cost #3: User Experience

Cookie consent banners exist because of tools like Google Analytics. They:

- Interrupt the user experience
- Add friction before content
- Require design/development resources
- Need ongoing maintenance

Sites using privacy-first analytics don't need these banners. That's a UX advantage you're giving up for "free" analytics.

### Cost #4: Trust Erosion

Consumers are increasingly privacy-aware. Studies show:

- 79% are concerned about how companies use their data
- 81% feel they have little control over data collection
- 48% have stopped buying from a company over privacy concerns

When visitors see your cookie consent banner listing Google Analytics and dozens of ad trackers, what message does that send?

### Cost #5: Accuracy Issues

Google Analytics isn't even that accurate anymore:

- **Ad blockers** block GA on 25-40% of visits (depending on audience)
- **Safari's ITP** limits tracking to 7 days
- **Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection** blocks third-party tracking
- **Brave, DuckDuckGo** block GA entirely

The "free" tool might be missing a third of your traffic.

### Cost #6: Complexity

GA4 is notoriously complex:

- Different data model than Universal Analytics
- Steep learning curve
- Report customization requires expertise
- Event tracking needs technical implementation

How many hours has your team spent trying to figure out GA4? What's that time worth?

## The True Cost Comparison

Let's do the math for a small business:

| Cost Item | Google Analytics | Zero Trust Analytics |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Subscription | $0 | $15/month |
| Cookie consent tool | $10-50/month | $0 |
| Legal review (annual) | $500-2000 | $0 |
| Page speed impact | $?? (lost conversions) | Negligible |
| Staff time (complexity) | 5-10 hrs/month | 1-2 hrs/month |
| Trust impact | $?? (hard to measure) | Positive |
| Regulatory risk | $?? (potentially huge) | $0 |

The "free" option is more expensive by almost every measure.

## What You Actually Need

Here's a secret: most businesses use a tiny fraction of Google Analytics' features.

The core questions are:
1. How many people visit my site?
2. Which pages are popular?
3. Where does traffic come from?
4. Is traffic growing or shrinking?

You don't need advertising-grade tracking for that. You don't need to feed the surveillance economy for that. You don't need to create regulatory risk for that.

Simple, privacy-first analytics gives you what you need at a fraction of the true cost.

## Making the Switch

Moving from Google Analytics to Zero Trust Analytics:

1. Sign up (2 minutes)
2. Add your site (1 minute)
3. Add our script (2 minutes)
4. Remove GA (5 minutes)
5. Delete your cookie consent banner (5 minutes)

Total time: ~15 minutes.

Monthly cost: $15.

Monthly savings: Cookie consent tool, legal risk, trust erosion, complexity headaches.

Sometimes the paid option is actually cheaper.
