# Zero Trust Analytics vs Google Analytics

Looking for a Google Analytics alternative that respects user privacy? Here's how Zero Trust Analytics compares.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Zero Trust Analytics | Google Analytics |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Price** | From $5/mo | Free (you're the product) |
| **Cookie-free** | Yes | No |
| **GDPR Compliant** | Yes, by design | Requires consent banner |
| **Script Size** | 3KB | 45KB+ |

## Why Switch from Google Analytics?

### 1. Privacy by Design

Google Analytics tracks users across the web, building detailed profiles for advertising. We take the opposite approach:

- **No cookies** - We don't use any cookies
- **No IP storage** - IPs are hashed with daily-rotating salt
- **No cross-site tracking** - Each site is isolated
- **No user profiles** - We can't identify individuals

### 2. No Consent Banners Needed

With Google Analytics, EU law requires you to show cookie consent banners. Studies show these banners reduce conversions by 5-10%.

With Zero Trust Analytics, you don't need consent banners because we don't collect personal data.

### 3. Better Performance

Our script is 3KB vs Google Analytics' 45KB+. That means:
- Faster page loads
- Better Core Web Vitals scores
- Improved SEO rankings

### 4. You Own Your Data

Google uses your website visitors' data to improve their ad targeting. With Zero Trust Analytics, your data stays yours.

To be transparent, here's what Google Analytics has that we don't:

- **Audience segments** - No remarketing audiences
- **Integration with Google Ads** - We're independent
- **Free tier** - Our plans start at $5/mo

## FAQ

**Is Zero Trust Analytics really GDPR compliant?**

Yes. We don't collect any personal data as defined by GDPR. No consent is required because there's nothing to consent to.

**Can I keep Google Analytics and use both?**

Yes, but you'll still need consent banners for GA. Many customers run both during a transition period.

**What about Google Search Console?**

Search Console is separate from Analytics and doesn't have the same privacy issues. You can use both.
