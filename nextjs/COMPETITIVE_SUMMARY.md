## ZTA's Sweet Spots (Where to Win)

**Market Size:** SMBs who need conversion tracking but can't afford $19+/mo.

### 2. Agency & Reseller Market
**The Gap:** Zero competitors offer white-label or reseller programs.

**Market Size:** 50,000+ web agencies in US alone.

### 3. Enterprise Compliance
**The Gap:** None have SOC 2, ISO 27001, or HIPAA options.
**ZTA Strategy:** Zero Trust security + compliance certifications.
**Market Size:** Healthcare, finance, education verticals.

### 4. Hybrid Deployment
**The Gap:**
- Plausible/Umami self-hosting is complex (Docker, manual setup)
