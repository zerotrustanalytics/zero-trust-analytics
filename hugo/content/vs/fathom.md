# Zero Trust Analytics vs Fathom

Fathom is a popular privacy-focused analytics tool. Here's how Zero Trust Analytics compares.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Zero Trust Analytics | Fathom |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| **Starting Price** | $5/mo | $15/mo |
| **Sites Included** | Unlimited | 50 sites |
| **100k pageviews** | $29/mo | $15/mo |
| **1M pageviews** | $79/mo | $35/mo |
| **Cookie-free** | Yes | Yes |
| **EU Data Isolation** | No | Yes |
| **API Access** | All plans | All plans |

## Where Zero Trust Analytics Wins

### 1. Lower Entry Price

Our Solo plan starts at $5/mo for 10k pageviews. Fathom's cheapest plan is $15/mo.

For bloggers, small sites, and side projects, we're 3x cheaper to get started.

### 2. Truly Unlimited Sites

Both platforms offer "unlimited" sites, but there's a difference:

- **Zero Trust Analytics**: Unlimited sites on ALL plans, starting at $5/mo
- **Fathom**: 50 sites included (technically limited)

For most users, 50 sites is plenty. But if you're an agency or have many properties, our unlimited approach is simpler.

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Architecture

We use a fundamentally different privacy approach:

- **Daily rotating salt** - Visitor IDs expire every 24 hours
- **No IP retention** - Not even hashed
- **Mathematical guarantees** - We can't de-anonymize data

Fathom anonymizes IPs and doesn't use cookies, but their architecture doesn't have the same mathematical impossibility guarantees.

## Where Fathom Wins

### 1. Better Value at High Volume

If you have lots of traffic, Fathom is more cost-effective:

| Pageviews | Zero Trust Analytics | Fathom |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| 10k | $5/mo | $15/mo |
| 100k | $29/mo | $15/mo |
| 1M | $79/mo | $35/mo |
| 10M | $199/mo | $90/mo |

Fathom's pricing scales better for high-traffic sites.

### 2. EU Data Isolation

Fathom offers EU-isolated infrastructure for European customers. We currently process all data in the US (with GDPR-compliant practices).

### 3. Established Platform

Fathom has been around since 2018 and has a strong track record. They've proven reliability at scale.

### 4. More Integrations

Fathom has official integrations with:
- WordPress
- Carrd
- Webflow
- Ghost
- And more

We're still building out our integration ecosystem.
