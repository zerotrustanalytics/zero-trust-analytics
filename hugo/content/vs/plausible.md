# Zero Trust Analytics vs Plausible

Both Zero Trust Analytics and Plausible are privacy-first alternatives to Google Analytics. Here's how they compare.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Zero Trust Analytics | Plausible |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Starting Price** | $5/mo | $9/mo |
| **Unlimited Sites** | Yes, all plans | No (1 site on starter) |
| **10k pageviews** | $5/mo | $9/mo |
| **100k pageviews** | $29/mo | $19/mo |
| **Cookie-free** | Yes | Yes |
| **Open Source** | No | Yes |
| **Self-hosting** | No | Yes |
| **API Access** | All plans | All plans |
| **Custom Events** | All plans | All plans |

## Where Zero Trust Analytics Wins

### 1. Unlimited Sites on Every Plan

Plausible charges per site. With Zero Trust Analytics, you get unlimited sites on every plan.

**If you have 5 websites:**
- Zero Trust Analytics: $5/mo (Solo plan)
- Plausible: $9/mo x 5 = $45/mo

For agencies and developers with multiple sites, ZTA is significantly more cost-effective.

### 2. True Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Both platforms are privacy-focused, but we take it further:

- **Daily salt rotation** - Visitor hashes expire every 24 hours
- **Mathematical impossibility** - We can't identify users even if compelled
- **No IP storage at all** - Not even hashed IPs are stored long-term

Plausible anonymizes data, but their architecture allows for potential re-identification in some edge cases.

### 3. Better Value at Scale

| Pageviews | Zero Trust Analytics | Plausible |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| 10k | $5/mo | $9/mo |
| 50k | $15/mo | $19/mo |
| 100k | $29/mo | $19/mo |
| 1M | $79/mo | $69/mo |
| 10M | $199/mo | $169/mo |

At lower volumes, we're cheaper. At higher volumes, Plausible has a slight edge - but remember we include unlimited sites.

## Where Plausible Wins

### 1. Open Source

Plausible is open source (AGPL licensed). You can inspect their code and even self-host.

Zero Trust Analytics is not open source. We believe our closed architecture provides stronger privacy guarantees, but some prefer open source transparency.

### 2. Self-Hosting Option

If you want to host analytics on your own servers, Plausible offers this. We're cloud-only.

### 3. Established Track Record

Plausible launched in 2019 and has a larger user base. They're a proven solution with years of reliability.
