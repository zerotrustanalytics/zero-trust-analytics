---

## Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (Week 1-2)

### P0 - Ship Blockers

- [x] **CSP Headers** - Add Content-Security-Policy to all responses ✅
  - Location: `netlify/functions/lib/auth.js`
  - Impact: XSS defense-in-depth
  - **COMPLETED:** Full CSP with script-src, style-src, connect-src, frame-ancestors

- [x] **CSRF Enforcement** - Validate CSRF token on all state-changing endpoints ✅
  - Files: `sites-update.js`, `sites-delete.js`, `sites-share.js`, `user-delete.js`
  - Impact: Prevents cross-site request forgery
  - **COMPLETED:** Added validateCSRFFromRequest() to all state-changing endpoints

- [x] **OAuth State Storage** - Move from cookie to server-side storage ✅
  - Location: `netlify/functions/auth-github.js`, `auth-google.js`, `auth-oauth-callback.js`
  - Impact: Prevents OAuth CSRF attacks
  - **COMPLETED:** Server-side state with 10-min TTL, one-time use, provider verification

- [x] **GDPR Data Export** - Add user data export endpoint ✅
  - New file: `netlify/functions/user-export.js`
  - Impact: GDPR Article 20 compliance
  - **COMPLETED:** Exports user profile, sites, sessions, API keys as JSON

- [x] **GDPR Data Deletion** - Add user data deletion endpoint ✅
  - New file: `netlify/functions/user-delete.js`
  - Impact: GDPR Article 17 compliance
  - **COMPLETED:** Full cascade deletion with confirmation, audit logging

### Detailed Security Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Missing Content Security Policy (CRITICAL)

**Current State:** No CSP headers in responses

**Required Implementation:**
```javascript
const csp = [
  "default-src 'self'",
  "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://js.stripe.com",
  "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
  "img-src 'self' data: https:",
  "font-src 'self'",
  "connect-src 'self' https://api.stripe.com https://*.turso.io",
  "frame-ancestors 'none'",
  "base-uri 'self'",
  "form-action 'self'"
].join('; ');
```

#### 2. CSRF Not Enforced (CRITICAL)

**Current State:** CSRF generation exists but validation not enforced

**Vulnerable Endpoints:**
- POST `/api/sites` (create)
- PUT `/api/sites/:id` (update)
- DELETE `/api/sites/:id` (delete)
- All other state-changing operations

#### 3. OAuth State Vulnerability (HIGH)

**Current State:** State stored in cookie, vulnerable to manipulation

**Fix:** Store state server-side with Netlify Blobs, enforce one-time use
